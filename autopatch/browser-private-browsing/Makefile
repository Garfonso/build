TITLE = Private Browsing
DESCRIPTION = Adds an option to the webOS browser that will prevent adding new items to the browser history.  It can be toggled with a menu item.  When enabled the browser toolbar will be turned red to make it obvious that it is on.The default behavior for a new card can be set using Tweaks.  A card opened from an open card will inherit the setting from the original card instead of applying the default.This patch also adds google secure as a browser option.
