TITLE = Phonetic Arabic Keyboard
DESCRIPTION = This patch is similar to amjz's in that it allows you to type in Arabic using the hardware keyboard on webOS phones (Pre-, Pre+, Pre2, Veer, Pre3).I am currently using it on my Pre2, Veer, and Pre3 successful. I used to have this installed on my Pre+ but don't have it anymore to test on. The keyboard layout is not the typical Arabic keyboard layout some of you may be familiar with. Instead it is based on an old XP windows keyboard layout by Gyula Zsigri (Arabic for Windows). This is designed to be easy for someone used to English keyboards. So, for example, the &#1605; is on the m, the &#1606; on the n, &#1576; on the b, etc... Arabic letters are paired to their English phonetic equivalents. This really helps in being able to type in Arabic if you're not familiar with the traditional Arabic Keyboard Layout.  More layout info can be found on the patch homepage (Phonetic Arabic Keyboard for webOS Phones @ webosnation.com). I will also respond to questions and provide support there.Double tap the SYM button to switch between Arabic and English!For best results, combine it CvvB's Arabization mod and Arabic font.Known bug: the first letter often does not display properly.  I use a comma to begin each line, feedback/help is appreciated!
